This is a static website template designed to present an argument in an engaging, interactive way.

## How to use

1.  **Open `index.html`** in a text editor.
2.  **Replace the placeholder text** with the content from your essay.
    *   Look for sections like `<!-- Argument Point 1 -->`.
    *   Replace the text inside `<h2>` and `<p>` tags.
3.  **Customize the illustrations**: You can replace the emojis in `<div class="illustration">` with images or other icons.
4.  **Open `index.html` in a browser** to view your site.

## Design Features

*   **High Saturation**: Uses bright pink, cyan, and yellow.
*   **Readable Fonts**: Uses 'Poppins' from Google Fonts.
*   **Interactive**: Card-based navigation with smooth transitions.

## How to Publish to GitHub Pages

Since you are already in a GitHub repository, publishing is easy!

1.  **Commit and Push your changes**:
    *   Open the Source Control tab in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+G).
    *   Type a message (e.g., "Finished website") and click **Commit**.
    *   Click **Sync Changes** (or Push) to send your code to GitHub.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.com (e.g., `https://github.com/Nicklovesfoxes/media`).
    *   Click on **Settings** (top right tab).
    *   On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Under **Branch**, select `main` and `/ (root)`.
    *   Click **Save**.

3.  **View your website**:
    *   Wait a minute or two for the site to build.
    *   Your website will be live at: `https://Nicklovesfoxes.github.io/media/website/`
    *   *(Note: We added `/website/` to the end because your files are in the `website` folder).*
