### **The Illusion of Choice, Media Influence**

The mainstream media ( top 90% ) has a large scale influence on people. It has been and is being used to drive public opinion. The press is a key part of our democracy. In an ideal system, the press should interact with and inform the people, and the people should then vote for what they believe is best. A democracy should make policy based on public opinion. Government leaders should put policies in place that reflect what the people want. However, a problem arises when an entity makes relationships with the press. Subtly or not so subtly, powerful actors ( government leaders, private companies, powerful people ) can manipulate media outlets to change there words, overall tone, and connotations when talking about controversial issues in order to shape and guide public opinion. Democracy is threatened when the vast majority of public media is controlled by a relatively small number of people who possess a significant amount of influence, significantly more than any one person should.

Public media especially the 90% has an large amount of influence that could be used to great effect. All media will impact public perceptions and attitudes. If the media focuses on something people will focus and assess it more, it typically can steer popular issues. If media talks about people on food stamps then viewers will assess food stamps. This influence often creates a gap between what people want and what the government actually does. Alexander Kustov describes the idea of "thermostatic politics," where public opinion reacts to government actions, and if policy shifts too far in one direction public opinion will tend to oppose it. The people will say something is wrong, and the democracy ideally will fix it. Kustov notes that voters rely on "general perceptions often shaped by media coverage"(pg 8). This suggests that if the media shapes the perception, they shape the political reality. Any type of press or media will have a notable effect.

This is further proved by history. Operation Mockingbird, revealed by the Church Committee in the 1970s, showed that in the Cold War the CIA had "official relationships" with 50 journalists and that hundreds of press members had carried out assignments for the agency. If the government and intelligence agencies believe they need to control media to guide the public, that only proves how crucial the media is and how in the past the media has been proven to be warped and used like a tool by our very own government. The government used long term tactics 50 years ago for propaganda in the Cold War, the modern day understanding of propaganda has only increased.

**Large Interest Groups, Elites, and the "Oligarchy"** In recent times it has been questioned how powerful votes and majority opinion really is. This could be a troubling reality where the United States may operate more like an oligarchy than a democracy. Martin Gilens, a political scientist and professor, said that there is "substantial support for theories of Economic Elite Domination"(pg. 3), and "average citizens and mass based interest groups have little or no independent influence"(pg. 3). If the media is owned or influenced by these same elites, the "public opinion" could equally be influenced by a reflection of their own interests and agenda. From his perspective any one person already does not have as much direct impact as an elite might. It makes sense. Wealthy people have a disproportionate amount of power.

Mark Carl Rom said that while interest groups can enhance a democracy by giving people a voice, they also allow people with the more money to make their voice significantly louder. A well funded lobby group will have the money to spend pressuring the government and lawmakers to influence policy with its agenda. For example, groups like AIPAC demonstrate how organized actors can wield immense bipartisan power, with major figures from both parties. The average citizen can only vote. People already don't have the effect a democracy might promise; even aside from the media, democracy is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Psychology** The way people shape the world and others is not only through complex political mechanisms, but also through complex psychological action. Directly affecting policy with money is always limited, and can only do so much. Using psychological tactics to bring others to a cause may open the doors for something else. Promoting something else to prevent change via distracting people is another way of moving the spotlight. 

As Bernard J. Luskin discusses regarding Media and Communications Psychology, he talked about how there is a deep connection between influence, psychology, and the digital world. Media has the power to influence individual beliefs and behaviors, often changing social norms. Eric Arias found that media is effective at persuading people and influencing norms, particularly when ideas are shared publicly and in more social ways rather than individually. This is a perfect way to create shared perceptions that feel organic over a long time period. Repeatedly showing what seems like the majority of people's beliefs will reinforce people who might already lean that way and alienate people who feel the other way, this is a common social strategy. The feeling of being left out or not being part of the group is deep and complex, it is effective and reliable to motivate and change others. Short term effects can be seen immediately in viral trends. If ads portray a specific behavior or product as universally accepted, the immediate pressure to buy it or accept it, creates a sudden urge to fit in. This is short term and entrenched beliefs override these sudden impulses. However repeated long term influence is more effective and able to have more weight. Resistance to new social norms or technologies fade as they become more popular. An individual might reject a concept as unnecessary or harmful, but over years of seeing a majority accept it, they become open to accepting it themselves. This long term effect is much more effective, overriding previous beliefs.

Shehata (2021) analyzed long term media effects, showing that researchers have made deep methods to measure and manipulate societal beliefs. This manipulation goes far beyond simple marketing, it is an attempt to shape perceptions and place ideas into people’s minds that they may not have formed on their own. We can see this clearly when news outlets frame events. Matt Carmichael from Ipsos noted that perceptions of the economy are now Complexly partisan, with Republicans “three times as likely to see positive news than Democrats.” This difference in perceived reality reflects the power of media framing and demonstrates that the media has a great influence in shaping beliefs. Looking back at the theory of "thermostatic politics" ( policy and public opinion should ideally follow each other ) Alexander Kustov described, shows how mainstream media directly affects how society responds to political decisions.

If the media can be controlled to exert influence, then that is bad proportional to the degree of outside bias. The evidence shows that through elite funding, psychological framing and historical government interference, the media has an immense capacity to shape reality. While independent journalism remains a necessary good, the mainstream media's susceptibility to the influence of a few powerful people and actors threatens democracy. If democracy is made of the people, their opinions must be their own, not manufactured or manipulated.

Politics, history, and psychology show how powerful media influence is. It is a primary force that drives democracy. Mainstream media shapes what people look at, how they interpret events, and ultimately guides their own beliefs. The rich and powerful already have so much pull in the government, it only compounds when the same people affect the media for their own agenda. Public opinion can be steered and diverted by dishonest popular media, making it easier for elites or other actors like the CIA to push ideas not in our best interest. Using deep long term psychological tactics media has the ability to reshape norms and override prior beliefs, in such a way that is very difficult to expose. If the public’s perceptions are shaped by media framing and subtle guidance, then the “thermostat” can be quietly adjusted in a way that is undemocratic.

The independence and integrity of the media shapes the world around us in a way that nothing else can, the popular media changes what is taboo and acceptable in society. Over time, the long term influence of media has made undeniable widespread changes, like the civil rights movement. However just by picking what they cover they choose what not to cover, this will indirectly shape the world by ignoring a problem, like pornographic addiction, or the responsibilities of a company sourcing their labor with horrible conditions. When influence is concentrated or manipulated, the more vulnerable democratic decision making becomes.
